"""MCP tools called by Confluent Cloud's Flink TRIAGEAGENT.

Built on the `mcp` Python SDK (installed version 2.2.0). Note: mcp 2.x
renamed FastMCP to MCPServer (mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer) with
otherwise-equivalent .tool()/.streamable_http_app() APIs -- confirmed by
inspecting the installed package, since 1.x-era `FastMCP` examples online
will raise ModuleNotFoundError on this version. Mounting the resulting
streamable-HTTP ASGI app onto an existing FastAPI app requires its
session manager's lifespan to be entered manually (see main.py) --
Starlette does not propagate a mounted sub-app's lifespan automatically.
