# RTCE itself has no Terraform resource type -- enabling it per-topic
# (on tickets.enriched, tickets.metrics, tickets.agent-actions) is a
# manual Console step (Console -> Topics -> Context Engine toggle),
# confirmed against docs.confluent.io during this project's planning.
# This mirrors the sibling project's approach exactly, and is also
# consistent with this demo's own design: the presenter already controls
# the incident/status flip manually so its timing is never automatic --
# a manual RTCE toggle isn't a new inconsistency.
#
# Terraform only provisions the querying credential: a "Global" API key,
# the exact pattern the sibling project uses for RTCE/Lightning Query
# access.
