# Amazon ECS Express Mode: one aws_ecs_express_gateway_service gives us a
# Fargate service + ALB + TLS + target group + networking, from just a
# container image and two IAM roles -- see PROJECT plan for why this was
# chosen over a plain aws_ecs_service (the app needs real HTTPS, unlike
# the sibling project's outbound-only ECS task).
#
# Bootstrap order (see deploy.py): (1) `terraform apply
# -target=aws_ecr_repository.app` creates just the registry so the image
# can be built and pushed against a real URI, (2) a full apply with
# var.app_image_uri set creates the service, (3) a second full apply
# with the now-known ingress hostname sets MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS correctly.
